# AIdemos
In this repo I put mine implementations of some basic AI algorithms, which are:
  
  path finding algorithms: Dijkstra, A*,
  
  MinMax with alpha-beta prunning,
  
  hidden Markov models,
  
  genetic algorithm,
  
  decision trees.
  
All algorithm were used to solve exemplary, academic problems.
